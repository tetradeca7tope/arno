Library for Actively Learning high valued functions using only a Lipschitz
assumption.

mbpObjective.m & mbpGradient.m: These functions construct function handles for
the objective and gradient you are trying to minimize. To construct them you
need to pass in the points at which you have already evaluated the funciton and
the transformation.

maxBandPoint.m : Function to pick the next point given the current points.

alMaxBandPoint.m : Runs maxBandPoint iteratively to pick a bunch of points.

ut_mbp_dim1 and ut_mbp_dim2 are unit tests in 1 and 2 dimensions respectively.
